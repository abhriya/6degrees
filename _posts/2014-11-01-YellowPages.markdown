If you clicked on this post just because of the headline and the pretty girl's picture, click-baiting works! Sorry. Hopefully, the rest of this post will be worth your click. 

<h3>Finding a cafe on a friend's phone:</h3>

Ever wondered which restaurants your friends like? Ever wanted to ask your friends for reommendations for the best plumber nearby, or maybe a good gym to go to? With [6degrees], you can search your these and find results - on your friends' phones. 

What we're saying is: don't be boring - don't just Google for what you want. Ask your friends. It's more fun that way. 

And if you have awesome places, shops and people on your phonebook, share them with your trusted friends and family - when people discover good places because of you, you're the hero!

<h3>What about Privacy?</h3>

Of course, your friends need to give you access - if they trust you, they will connect to you on 6degrees. And as described in our [previous post], they can decide which contacts from their 6degrees phonebook are accessible to you. Besides - you can't just open a particular friend's contact list and go through it - you have to search for a specific thing that you are looking for. Like "cafe" or "Dr". Here's what you'll see.

<h3>Get the details</h3>

You can either click on the "Contacts of Contacts" category to view cafes on your friends' phones, or click on "Nearby Places" to view cafes located near you. Remember to switch on your phone's location-sharing. 

Currently, we're showing you these nearby places using Google's Places feature. But soon, there will be more listings here from local partners.

To learn exactly how to request a cafe's details from a friend's phone in the "Contacts of Contacts" category, read our [previous post].

<h3>Why we're doing this:</h3>

This yellow-pages-like feature in 6degrees was born from our belief that your personal network isn't just about family & friends - it includes other people who provide little services to you on a daily basis, and whom you might need at any time - your driver, your plumber, or a restaurant near your house. But most of these are unknown to us, and we often discover these through our network - our friends. That's what we're trying to unshackle - the power of your network.
