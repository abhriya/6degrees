You may voluntarily choose not to make your information known to others in your network by making your profile un-sharable in the settings screen. You may also choose to make your contacts invisible in searches by your friends by marking them as private. However, when you choose to share your phonebook information, then you agree that your contacts’ information will be seen in searches by individuals in your personal network of friends and partially by everyone on 6degrees. You might be requested by others in the network to share your contact’s or your own details with them. We can neither preview or control what users share with others.</li>
