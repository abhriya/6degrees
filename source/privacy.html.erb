  <p>Abhriya Pte Ltd (&ldquo;Abhriya&rdquo;) offers you 6degrees - your connected phonebook.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The 6degrees system begins to access your phone contacts only after you have registered with us, and not immediately upon download/install.</li>
    <li>6degrees will not disclose any of your data to any external party unless required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process or governmental request (such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order).</li>
    <li>6degrees may scan through your data in order to provide customized services to you. This process is automated and does not involve human intervention. 6degrees will never share your data with advertisers or other third parties without your permission.</li>
    <li>6degrees treats your data as private by default, except for specific situations such as user search, where your name and photograph are searchable by other users by default. However, you have the option to prevent this and to stop sharing your profile from the settings page.</li>
    <li>6degrees gives you the ability to share some of your data with other 6degrees members. The decision to share or send your data is yours and yours alone. In some cases, your friends may choose to share your contact details with others without your permission. 6degrees does not take the responsibility for your friendsâ€™ decision to share your contact with others.</li>
    <li>6degrees employees have no access to your data unless you explicitly request customer support for a problem related to your account, and even then only to the extent necessary to solve your problem.</li>
